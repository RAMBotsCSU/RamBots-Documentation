**Booting Up the RAMBot**
========================

1. Make sure you have proper powering either from the power supply or batteries
   a. For batteries, use the cell-checker to ensure all batteries are above 22.1V
      (3.7V per cell)
2. Power on the RamBOT using the power switch which can be found on the back of the robot
3. Once the Raspberry Pi has booted up, you'll find a shell script on the desktop called `startup.sh`
4. Run the script by double-clicking it and selecting "Run in Terminal"

Now you should be good to go! If you run into any issues, please refer to the troubleshooting section.
