Removing a Leg
==============

Procedure
---------

1. Unscrew the motor connections from the ODESCs.

2. Remove the four screws that secure the top plate holding the ODESCs.

3. With the top plate removed, you have access to the electronics inside Sparky. Carefully disconnect the encoder cables from the ODESCs as needed. Do not pull on the ODESCs or cables — excessive force can damage the connectors.

4. Remove the sixteen screws that hold the leg to the robot. The views below show screw locations:

5. Slide the leg off and keep parts organized for reassembly.

Reassembly
----------

Reverse the steps above to reattach the leg. Hand-tighten fasteners initially and torque to spec if required.

.. note::
   Be cautious when reconnecting encoder cables and routing wires. Verify all connections before powering the robot.

.. warning::
   Do not yank on the ODESC or wires. Damaging the encoder connectors may require repairs or encoder reinitialization.
   Additonally, be careful not to damage the encoder plate, as it can change offset values and require recalibration.
